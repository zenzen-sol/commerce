## Providers

Vercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).

Vercel is happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.

- Shopify (this repository)
- [BigCommerce](https://github.com/bigcommerce/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://next-commerce-v2.vercel.app/))

## Integrations

Integrations enable upgraded or additional functionality for Next.js Commerce

- [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce.oramasearch.com/))
  - Upgrades search to include typeahead with dynamic re-rendering, vector-based similarity search, and JS-based configuration.
  - Search runs entirely in the browser for smaller catalogs or on a CDN for larger.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
