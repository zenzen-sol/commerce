While many breweries typically use a stable water source such as well water, narai uses the fresh water from the mountains, flowing from an altitude of over 1,000m. The water originates from a spring near the watershed of the Shinano River and Kiso River, and is characterized by its clarity and smooth, rounded texture, brought about by a rare water hardness of less than 25."

After the cold winter, the town gets enveloped in fresh greenery as the air turns more clear and pleasant. In autumn, the mountains are adorned with vibrant foliage.

				"para002": "Most sake breweries use large tanks (3,000L to 8,000L) suitable for mass production, often dividing tasks across a large team. At our brewery, we have scaled down to smaller tanks (900L to 1,800L) so that our single master brewer can meticulously and efficiently manage every step of the brewing process – enabling us to produce high-quality sake through small-lot production. Further, while sake is typically produced in the winter, we have incorporated a year-round production method called “shiki-jozo,” or “four-seasons brewing,” so that we can reflect the changing seasons and beautiful nature of Nagano in our sake."

Yet the concept of “A Colorful Black” is not about one single color, but rather a mixture of colors, meticulously layered together one paint at a time. For each batch of narai, I imagine myself harmonizing the various elements of the sake’s flavor – richness and fullness, dryness and sweetness, aroma – carefully adjusting each element according to the conditions of the mountain water and rice of that particular batch. A sake that is well-balanced, yet feels like a burst of colors as it spreads across your palate… this is the kind of sake I hope to create. We hope you enjoy narai – “water of the mountains, sake of the skies” – a sake that expresses the beautiful nature of Nagano.",

At 30, also recognizing the importance of branding in the realm of sake, Irie moved to Matsumoto Sake Brewery in Kyoto where he worked under master brewer Hidehiko Matsumoto for 5 years. Building on these experiences, Irie came to suginomori brewery as master brewer, with a goal to create a unique sake from his own vision."

			"para005": "In the process of the renewal, we sought to confront some of the challenges faced by the sake industry in recent years: a decline in domestic demand for sake, the subsequent closing down of many local sake breweries and rise in abandoned farmland, and unstable employment due to sake typically being produced only in the winter months.",
			"para006": "We listened to the voices of farmers. We visited the rice paddies, and took part in the rice cultivation process. We incorporated a year-round production method called “shiki-jozo,” or “four-seasons brewing,” to ensure a more stable production environment. Although seemingly small steps, we believe that these are some of the building blocks for a more promising future.",
			"para007": "Additionally, as part of our endeavor, we sought to transform the brewery into what we call an “open brewery.” suginomori brewery is adjoined to the restaurant of BYAKU Narai, an accommodation facility renovated from part of the former Suginomori Shuzo. Visitors can look into the brewery from a large glass window in the restaurant, providing them with a rare up-close view of the sake brewing process. Through opening and showcasing our brewery, we hope to inspire more people to take an interest in sake.",
			"para008": "Finally, our brand name “narai” is derived from the town of Narai-juku – chosen from our hope to introduce this charming town to the world through our sake. If you ever find yourself in Narai-juku, we would be delighted to welcome you to suginomori brewery.",
