				"para002": "我們希望通過味道來展現這片大自然豐富的魅力。 一般的酒廠都是以大型團隊利用大型酒桶（3,000升〜8,000升等）進行大規模分工生產。然而，在我們的酒廠裡，即使只有一位釀酒師，也會通過精密的手工有效率地參與整個生產過程。雖然是小批量的生產，但是我們採用900升和1,800升的小型酒桶來確保高品質的釀造。此外，大多數的酒廠只在冬季釀造，但是為了將自然的美融入味道裡，我們採取可以全年四季都能生產的釀造方式。"

			"para004": "位於長野縣被稱為日本最長的宿場町「奈良井宿」的歷史街區中，老字號酒廠「杉之森酒造」於1793年創立，2012年進入休業狀態。直到2021年，將生產面積縮小至原來的1/3，並加入全新的設備，以「suginomori brewery」名義再出發。",
			"para005": "在重新出發的過程中，我們意識到近年日本酒在日本國內的需求下降，對地區生活有緊密關係的酒廠愈來愈少，導致放棄耕作的土地增加，加上一般的酒廠只在冬季釀酒令到工作不穩定等問題，我們酒廠都會真誠地面對這些難題。",
			"para006": "我們直接與農家溝通，親自走入農田，從種米開始一起參與。",
			"para007": "導入全年四季都能釀酒的釀造方式，實現了一個穩定的釀造環境。",
			"para008": "雖然只是微細的努力，但我們相信只要累積這些努力一定會對未來產生很大的影響。",
			"para009": "此外，另一個相關的挑戰是開設「開放的酒廠」。我們酒廠與同一地方內的傳統民居和舊酒廠改建的住宿設施（BYAKU Narai）的餐廳相鄰。透過一塊大玻璃，能夠近距離見到平時難以見到的釀造過程，相信這會是引起對日本酒感興趣的契機。",
			"para010": "最後，我們的品牌【narai】寓意着透過我們的酒，令世界的人認識到奈良井宿的魅力，並親自去當地體驗。如果到奈良井時，請一定到suginomori brewery參觀。"
